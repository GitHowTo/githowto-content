I've opened this repository in order to give people ability to translate content of githowto.com to their languages.

Steps to create your translation:

1. Fork this repository.
2. In your fork, copy directory "en" (or any other language version) with all of it's content and rename it to the language code you're going to translate to.
3. Translate each of the text files inside the directory. Do not change the file names. Note, that the content is in Markdown format, although it is heavily using HTML. 
4. Submit a pull request.
5. Once pull request is accepted, the translation will appear on the website.
