title: "4. Checking the status of the repository"

<h3>Goals</h3>

<ul><li>To learn how to check the repository’s status</li></ul>

<h2><em>01</em> Check the status of the repository</h2>

<p>Use the <code>git status</code> command, to check the current state of the repository.</p>

<h4 class="h4-pre">Run:</h4>

<pre class="instructions">git status</pre>

<p>You will see</p>

<h4 class="h4-pre">Result:</h4>

<pre class="sample">$ git status
# On branch master
nothing to commit (working directory clean)</pre>

<p>The command checks the status and reports that there’s nothing to commit, meaning the repository stores the current state of the working directory, and there are no changes to record.</p>

<p>We will use the git status, to keep monitoring the states of both the working directory and the repository.</p>
