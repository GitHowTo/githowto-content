title: "36. Multiple repositories"
---

<p>So far we have been working with only one git repository. However, git is great for working with several repositories.  These additional repositories can be stored locally, or accessed via network connection.</p>

<p>In the next section we will create a new repo called &#8220;cloned_hello&#8221;.  We will discuss moving changes from one repo to another, and dealing with conflicts when working with two repositories.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, we will work with local repositories (the ones stored on your local HDD). Most of the information in this section can be also applied to working with multiple repositories no matter if they are stored locally or shared over a network.</p>

<p style="color:red;"><strong><span class="caps">NOTE</span>:</strong> We will make changes to both copies of our repositories. Notice the repository you are on every stage of the next lessons.</p>
