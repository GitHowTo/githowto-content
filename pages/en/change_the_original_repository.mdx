title: "34. Changing the original repository"
---

### Goals

- To make changes to the original repository, so we can try to pull the changes.

## _01_ Make a change in the original `work` repository

<Run>
```
cd ../work
```
</Run>

<p className="highlight">We are now in the `work` repository.</p>

Make the following changes to the `README` file:

<File file="README">
```
This is the Hello World example from the Git tutorial.
(changed in origin)
```
</File>

Now add and commit this change

<Run>
```
git add README
git commit -m "Changed README in original repo"
```
</Run>

## _02_ Next

Now the original repo has more recent changes that are not included in the cloned version. Next we will pull those changes across to the cloned repo.
