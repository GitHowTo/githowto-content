title: "12. Discarding local changes (before staging)"
---

### Goals

- Learn how to discard the working directory changes.

## _01_ Checking out the `main` branch

Make sure you are on the latest commit in the `main` branch before you continue.

<Run>
```
git switch main
```
</Run>

## _02_ Change `hello.html`

Sometimes you have modified a file in your local working directory and you wish to just revert to what has already been committed. The `checkout` command will handle that.

Make changes to the `hello.html` file in the form of an unwanted comment.

<File file="hello.html">
```html
<html>
  <head>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Hello, World!</h1>
    →<!-- This is a bad comment. We want to revert it. -->←
  </body>
</html>
```
</File>

## _03_ Check the status

First of all, check the working directory’s status.

<Run>
```
git status
```
</Run>

<Output>
```git
==include[output/12-01.txt]
```
</Output>

We see that the `hello.html` file has been modified, but not staged yet.

## _04_ Undoing the changes in the working directory

Use the `checkout` command in order to check out the repository's version of the `hello.html` file.

<Run>
```
git checkout hello.html
git status
cat hello.html
```
</Run>

<Output>
```git
==include[output/12-02.txt]
```
</Output>

The `status` command shows there were no unstaged changes in the working directory. And the "bad comment" is no longer contained in the file.
