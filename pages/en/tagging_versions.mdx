title: "11. Tagging versions"
---

### Goals

- Learn how to tag commits for future references.

For most people working with hashes directly is annoying at best. Wouldn't it be great if you could label specific commits with human-readable names? This way you could clearly see important milestones in the project history. Moreover, you could easily check out to a specific version of the project by its name. For this reason, Git has a feature called "tags".

Let's call the current version of the `hello.html` page as version 1: `v1`.

## _01_ Creating a tag for the first version

<Run>
```
git tag v1
git log
```
</Run>

<Output>
```git
==include[output/11-01.txt]
```
</Output>

Now, the current version of the page is referred to as `v1`.

## _02_ Tags for previous versions

Let's tag the version prior to the current version with the name `v1-beta`. First of all we will check out the previous version. Instead of looking up the hash of the commit, we are going to use the `^` notation, specifically `v1^`, indicating the commit previous to `v1`.

> If the `v1^` notation gives you any trouble, you can also try `v1~1`, which will reference the same version. The `V~N` notation means "the N-th version prior to V", or in case of `v1~1`, first version prior to `v1`.

<Run>
```
git checkout v1^
cat hello.html
```
</Run>

<Output>
```git
==include[output/11-02.txt]
```
</Output>

This is the version with `<html>` and `<body>` tags, but without `<head>`. Let's make itâ€™s the `v1-beta` version.

<Run>
```
git tag v1-beta
git log
```
</Run>

<Output>
```git
==include[output/11-03.txt]
```
</Output>

## _03_ Check out by the tag name

Now try to check out between the two tagged versions.

<Run>
```
git checkout v1
git checkout v1-beta
```
</Run>

<Output>
```git
==include[output/11-04.txt]
```
</Output>

## _04_ Viewing tags with the `tag` command

You can see the available tags using the `git tag` command.

<Run>
```
git tag
```
</Run>

<Output>
```git
==include[output/11-05.txt]
```
</Output>

## _05_ Viewing tags in logs

You can also check for tags in the log.

<Run>
```
git log main --all
```
</Run>

<Output>
```git
==include[output/11-06.txt]
```
</Output>

You can see tags (`v1` and `v1-beta`) listed in the log together with the name of the branch (`main`). The `HEAD` marker shows the commit you checked out (currently `v1-beta`).
