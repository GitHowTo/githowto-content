title: "7. Committing the changes"

### Goals

- Learn to commit to the repository.

## _01_ Committing changes

Well, enough about staging. Let's commit the staged changes to the repository.

When you previously used `git commit` for committing the first `hello.html` version to the repository, you included the `-m` flag that gives a comment on the command line. The `commit` command allows interactively editing comments for the commit. And now, let's see how it works.

If you omit the `-m` flag from the command line, Git will pop you into the editor of your choice from the list (in order of priority):

- `GIT_EDITOR` environment variable;
- `core.editor` configuration setting;
- `VISUAL` environment variable;
- `EDITOR` environment variable.

> I have the `EDITOR` variable set to `vim`. If you prefer GUI editor, it's now possible to use VS Code as a [Git editor](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/sourcecontrol/overview#_vs-code-as-git-editor).

Let us commit now and check the status.

<Run>
```
git commit
```
</Run>

You will see the following in your editor:

<Output>
```git
|
# Please enter the commit message for your changes. Lines starting
# with '#' will be ignored, and an empty message aborts the commit.
#
# On branch main
# Changes to be committed:
#       modified:   hello.html
#
```
</Output>

On the first line, enter the comment: `Added h1 tag`. Save the file and exit the editor (to do it in default editor, press ESC and then type `:wq` and hit Enter). You should see:

<Output>
```git
==include[output/07-01.txt]
```
</Output>

"Waiting for Emacs&#8230;" is obtained from the `emacsclient` program sending the file to a running emacs program and waiting for it to be closed. The rest of the data is the standard commit messages.

## _02_ Checking the status

At the end let us check the status.

<Run>
```
git status
```
</Run>

You will see:

<Output>
```git
==include[output/07-02.txt]
```
</Output>

The working directory is clean, you can continue working.
