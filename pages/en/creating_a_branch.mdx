### Goals

- Learn how to create a local branch in the repository.

Developing a new feature is always risky: it may take a while, you might want to cancel it in the end, etc. For this reason, it is best to isolate feature development in a separate branch. When the feature is ready, you can merge that branch into the `main` branch. Until then, your `main` is kept safe from risky and untested code. Moreover, you can work on multiple features in parallel, each in its own branch. You can also commit to `main` at any time, for example, to fix a bug.

## _01_ Create a branch

It is time to make our page more stylish with a touch of CSS. We'll develop this feature in a new branch called `style`.

<Run>
```
git switch -c style
git status
```
</Run>

> Old timers may object because they were taught to create branches with the `git checkout -b style` command. Remember I mentioned that the `checkout` command is overloaded with features and flags? The old way still works, but it's discouraged. The new `git switch` command is more expressive and less error-prone. It also has fewer flags and options, so it's easier to remember.

<Output>
```git
==include[output/18-01.txt]
```
</Output>

Note that the `git status` command reports that we are in the `style` branch.

## _02_ Add the `style.css` file

<Run>
```
touch style.css
```
</Run>

<File file="style.css">
```css
h1 {
  color: red;
}
```
</File>

<Run>
```
git add style.css
git commit -m "Added css stylesheet"
```
</Run>

## _03_ Change `hello.html` to use `style.css`

<File file="hello.html">
```html
<!-- Author: Alexander Shvets (alex@githowto.com) -->
<html>
  <head>
    →<link type="text/css" rel="stylesheet" media="all" href="style.css" />←
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Hello, World!</h1>
  </body>
</html>
```
</File>

<Run>
```
git add hello.html
git commit -m "Included stylesheet into hello.html"
```
</Run>

## _04_ Next

We now have a new branch named `style` with two new commits. In the next lesson, we will see how to switch between branches.
