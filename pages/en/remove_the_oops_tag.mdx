---

### Goals

- Removing the `oops` tag.

## _01_ Removal of the `oops` tag

The `oops` tag has performed its function. Let us remove that tag and permit the garbage collector to delete referenced commit.

<Run>
```
git tag -d oops
git log --all
```
</Run>

<Output>
```git
==include[output/16-01.txt]
```
</Output>

The `oops` tag will no longer appear in the repository.
