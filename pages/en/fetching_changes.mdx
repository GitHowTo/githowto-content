title: "35. Fetching changes"
---

### Goals

- Learn how to pull changes from a remote repository.

<Run>
```
cd ../home
git fetch
git log --all
```
</Run>

<p className="highlight">We are now in the `home` repository.</p>

<Output>
```git
==include[output/35-01.txt]
```
</Output>

At the moment, the repository contains all the commits from the original repo; however, they aren't integrated into the local branches of the cloned repository.

You'll find the commit named "Changed README in original repo" in the history. Notice that the commit includes `origin/main` and `origin/HEAD`.

Now let's take a look at the "Renamed hello.html; moved style.css" commit. You'll see that the local `main` branch points to this very commit, not the new commit we've just fetched.

This brings us to the conclusion that the `git fetch` command will fetch new commits from the remote repo, but won't merge them into the local branches.

## _01_ Check the README

We can show that the cloned `README` file has not been changed.

<Run>
```
cat README
```
</Run>

<Output>
```git
==include[output/35-02.txt]
```
</Output>

No changes, as you can see.
