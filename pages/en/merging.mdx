### Goals

- Learn how to merge two distinct branches to restore changes to a single branch.

## _01_ Merge the branches

Merging brings changes from two branches into one. Let us go back to the `style` branch and merge it with `main`.

<Run>
```
git switch style
git merge main
git log --all --graph
```
</Run>

<Output>
```git
==include[output/23-01.txt]
```
</Output>

Through periodic `main` branch merging with the `style` branch you can pick up any changes or modifications to the `main` to maintain compatibility with the `style` changes in the mainline.

However, it does produce ugly commit graphs. Later we will look at the option of rebasing rather than merging.

## _02_ Next

But what if changes to the `main` branch conflict with changes in `style`?
