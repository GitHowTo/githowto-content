title: "30. Cloning repositories"
---

### Goals

- Learn how to make copies of the repositories.

If you are working in a team, the following 8 lessons are quite important to understand because you almost always have to work with cloned repositories.

## _01_ Go to your `repositories` directory

<Run>
```
cd ..
pwd
ls
```
</Run>

<p className="highlight">Now we are in the `repositories` directory.</p>

<Output>
```git
==include[output/30-01.txt]
```
</Output>

At this point you should be in your `repositories` directory. It should contain a single repository named `work`.

## _02_ Create a clone of the `work` repository

Let's create a clone of the repository.

<Run>
```
git clone work home
ls
```
</Run>

<Output>
```git
==include[output/30-02.txt]
```
</Output>

Right now there should now be two repos in your working directory: the original `work` repo and the cloned repository named `home`.
