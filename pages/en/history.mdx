### Goals

- Learn to view the projectâ€™s history.

Getting a list of changes made is a function of the `git log` command.

<Run>
```
git log
```
</Run>

You will see:

<Output>
```git
==include[output/09-01.txt]
```
</Output>

Here is a list of all the four commits to the repository, which we were able to make so far.

## _01_ One line history

You fully control what the `log` shows. I like the single line format:

<Run>
```
git log --oneline
```
</Run>

You will see:

<Output>
```git
==include[output/09-02.txt]
```
</Output>

## _02_ Controlling the display of entries

Here are some other interesting options for viewing history:

<Run no_title={true}>
```
git log --oneline --max-count=2
git log --oneline --since="5 minutes ago"
git log --oneline --until="5 minutes ago"
git log --oneline --author="Your Name"
git log --oneline --all
```
</Run>

There is a huge variety of log viewing options, you can poke around the [git-log](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-log) manual page to see them all.

## _03_ Getting fancy

This is what I use to review the changes made within the last week. I will add `--author=Alexander` if I want to see only the changes made by me.

<Run no_title={true}>
```
git log --all --pretty=format:"%h %cd %s (%an)" --since="7 days ago"
```
</Run>

## _04_ The ultimate format of the log

Over time, I found the following log format to be the most suitable.

<Run>
```
git log --pretty=format:"%h %ad | %s%d [%an]" --date=short
```
</Run>

It looks like this:

<Output>
```git
==include[output/09-03.txt]
```
</Output>

Let's look at it in detail:

- `--pretty="..."` defines the output format.
- `%h` is the abbreviated hash of the commit.
- `%ad` is the commit date.
- `|` is just a visual separator.
- `%s` is the comment.
- `%d` commit decorations (e.g. branch heads or tags).
- `%an` is the name of the author.
- `--date=short` keeps the date format short and nice.

So, every time you want to see a log, you'll have to do a lot of typing. Fortunately, there are several Git config options to adjust the default log output format:

<Run>
```
git config --global format.pretty '%h %ad | %s%d [%an]'
git config --global log.date short
```
</Run>

## _05_ Other tools

Both `gitx` (for Mac) and `gitk` (for any platform) can help to explore log history.
