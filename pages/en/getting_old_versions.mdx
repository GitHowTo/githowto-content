title: "10. Getting older versions"
---

### Goals

- Learn how to check out any previous version into the working directory.

Git make time traveling possible, at least for your project. The `checkout` command will update your working directory to any previous commit.

## _01_ Getting hashes of the previous commit

<Run>
```
git log
```
</Run>

<Output>
```git
==include[output/10-01.txt]
```
</Output>

Check the log data and find the hash of the initial commit. You will find it in the last line of the output. Use the hash (its first 7 characters are enough) in the command below. After that check the contents of the `hello.html` file.

<Run>
```
git checkout <hash>
cat hello.html
```
</Run>

> Many Git commands accept commit hashes as arguments. Commit hashes will vary from repository to repository, so when you see a command with the `<hash>` mark, it means that you need to substitute it with the actual hash from your repository.

You will see:

<Output>
```git
==include[output/10-02.txt]
```
</Output>

Note that the current content of the `hello.html` file is the content that we started with in the very beginning.

## _02_ Returning to the latest version in the `main` branch

To return to the latest version of our code, we need to switch to the default `main` branch. We can use the `switch` command to switch between branches.

> The `checkout` command has been a swiss army knife in the world of Git for a long time. It has tons of various options that let you run entirely different things: switch branches, reset code, etc. At some point, the Git team decided to split the command into several commands. The `switch` command is one of themâ€”its sole purpose is to switch between branches. The `checkout` command is still available, but it is no longer recommended to use it for switching branches.

<Run>
```
git switch main
cat hello.html
```
</Run>

You will see:

<Output>
```git
==include[output/10-03.txt]
```
</Output>

`main` is the name of the default branch. By switching to a branch, you go to its latest version.
