title: "39. Adding a remote repository"

### Goals

- To add a bare repo as a remote to our original repo.

Let's add the `work.git` repository to our original repository.

<Run>
```
cd work
git remote add shared ../work.git
```
</Run>

<p className="highlight">We are now in the `work` repository.</p>
