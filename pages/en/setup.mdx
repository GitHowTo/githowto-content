### Goals

- Prepare the materials of the tutorial.

## _01_ Download the tutorial materials

You can download the tutorial materials from the following link:

- [https://githowto.com/githowto.zip](/githowto.zip)

## _02_ Extract the tutorial materials

The tutorial package contains two directories:

- `repositories`: an empty directory where you will create your repositories.
- `files`: contains prepackaged files that allow you to pick up the tutorial at any stage. If you encounter any difficulties, simply replace your repositories with the files from a corresponding lesson inside this directory.
