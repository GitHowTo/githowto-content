title: "37. Adding a tracking branch"
---

### Goals

- Learn how to add a local branch that tracks a remote branch.

Branches that start with `remotes/origin` belong to the original repository. Note that you don't have a `style` branch anymore, but Git knows that it was in the original repository.

## _01_ Add a local branch tracking the remote branch

<Run>
```
git branch --track style origin/style
git branch -a
git log --max-count=2
```
</Run>

<Output>
```git
==include[output/37-01.txt]
```
</Output>

Now we can see the `style` branch in the branch list and log.
