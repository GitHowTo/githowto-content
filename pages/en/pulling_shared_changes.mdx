title: "41. Pulling shared changes"

### Goals

- Learn how to pull changes from the shared repository.

Quickly switch to the `home` repository and pull the changes we just sent to the shared repository.

<Run>
```
cd ../home
```
</Run>

<p className="highlight">We are now in the `home` repository.</p>

Continue with...

<Run>
```
git remote add shared ../work.git
git branch --track shared main
git pull shared main
cat README
```
</Run>

<Output>
```git
==include[output/41-01.txt]
```
</Output>
