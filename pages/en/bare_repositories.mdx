title: "38. Bare repos"

### Goals

- Learn to create bare repos.

A bare repository is a repository that doesn't have a working directory. It only contains the `.git` directory, the directory in which Git stores all its internal data. The main purpose of these repositories is to be a central repository that developers can push to and pull from, so there's no need in having a working directory. Bare repositories are also used in Git hosting services like GitHub and GitLab. In the next several lessons we will learn how to create a bare repository and how to push to it.

## _01_ Creating a bare repository.

<Run>
```
cd ..
git clone --bare work work.git
ls work.git
```
</Run>

<p className="highlight">Now we are in the `repositories` directory.</p>

<Output>
```git
==include[output/38-01.txt]
```
</Output>

The convention is that repositories ending in `.git` are bare repositories. We can see that there is no working directory in the `work.git` repo. Essentially it is nothing but the `.git` directory of a regular repo.
