title: "33. Remote branches"
---

### Goals

- Learn about local and remote branches.

Let's take a look at the branches in our cloned repository.

<Run>
```
git branch
```
</Run>

<Output>
```git
$ git branch
* main
```
</Output>

As we can see only the `main` branch is listed in it. Where is the `style` branch? `git branch` only lists the local branches by default.

## _01_ 01 List of the remote branches

To see all the branches, try the following command:

<Run>
```
git branch -a
```
</Run>

<Output>
```git
$ git branch -a
* main
  remotes/origin/HEAD -> origin/main
  remotes/origin/style
  remotes/origin/main
```
</Output>

Git lists all the branches from the original repo, but the remote repository branches are not treated as local ones. If we need our own **style** branch, we need to create it on our own. In a minute you will see how it is done.
