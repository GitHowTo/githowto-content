title: "36. Merging pulled changes"
---

### Goals

- Learn to get the fetched changes into the current branch and working directory.

## _01_ Merge the pulled changes into the local `main` branch

<Run>
```
git merge origin/main
```
</Run>

<Output>
```git
==include[output/36-01.txt]
```
</Output>

## _02_ Check the `README` again

Now we should see the changes.

<Run>
```
cat README
```
</Run>

<Output>
```git
==include[output/36-02.txt]
```
</Output>

These are the changes. Although `git fetch` does not merge the changes, we can manually merge them from the remote repo.

## _03_ The `pull` command

The `fetch` command gives you precise control over what is pulled and merged, but for convenience, there is also a command `pull` which fetches and merges changes from the remote branch into your current branch with one call.

```
git pull
```

...is equivalent to the following two steps:

```
git fetch
git merge origin/main
```
