title: "32. What is origin?"
---

### Goals

- Learn about the naming of the remote repositories.

<Run>
```
git remote
```
</Run>

<Output>
```git
==include[output/32-01.txt]
```
</Output>

We see that the cloned repository knows the default name of the remote repository. To get more information about origin:

<Run>
```
git remote show origin
```
</Run>

<Output>
```git
==include[output/32-02.txt]
```
</Output>

We can see that the `origin` of the remote repository is the original `work` repo. Remote repos are typically stored on a separate machine or a centralized server. However, as we see, they can also point to a repository on the same machine. There is nothing so special about the name `origin`, but there is a convention to use it for the primary centralized repository (if any).
