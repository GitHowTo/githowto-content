> Hey, congrats for making it this far! Please consider this a bonus topic.

### Goals

- Learn how to set up Git server for sharing repositories.

Want to make your own GitHub? There are many ways to share Git repositories over the network. Here is a quick and dirty way.

## _01_ Launch the Git server

<Run>
```
# (From the "repositories" directory)
git daemon --verbose --export-all --base-path=.
```
</Run>

Now, go to your `repositories` directory in a separate terminal window.

<Run>
```
# (From the "repositories" directory)
git clone git://localhost/work.git network_work
cd network_work
ls
```
</Run>

You will find a copy of the `work` project.

## _02_ Pushing to the Git Daemon

If you want to allow push to the repository Git Daemon, add `--enable=receive-pack` tag to the `git daemon` command. Be attentive, this server does not perform authentication, so anyone can push changes to your repository.

## _03_ Sharing repositories

At this point, sky is the limit. Go wild! Rent a server, buy a domain name, host your repositories on this server, and you'll enjoy your private GitHub!

Seriously, though, you can host your own private [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/). It's free and open source.
