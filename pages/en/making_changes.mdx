### Goals

- Learn to monitor the working directory’s state.

## _01_ Changing the “Hello, World” page

Let's add some HTML-tags to our greeting. Change the file contents to:

<File file="hello.html">
```html
→<h1>←Hello, World!→</h1>←
```
</File>

## _02_ Checking the status

Check the working directory’s status.

<Run>
```
git status
```
</Run>

You will see:

<Output>
```git
==include[output/04-01.txt]
```
</Output>

The first important aspect here is that Git knows `hello.html` file has been changed, but these changes are not yet committed to the repository.

Another aspect is that the status message hints about what to do next. If you want to add these changes to the repository, use `git add`. To undo the changes use `git checkout`.
