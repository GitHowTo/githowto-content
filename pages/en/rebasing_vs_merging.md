title: "31. Relocating as an alternative to merging"
---

<h3>Goals</h3>

<ul><li>To learn the difference between relocating and merging.</li></ul>

<h3>Discussion</h3>

<p>Let us look at the differences between relocating and merging. To do this, we need to get back into the repository at the time prior to the first merge, and then repeat the same steps but using relocating instead of merging.</p>

<p>We will use the reset command to return the branch to a previous state.</p>
