title: "13. Cancel staged changes (before committing)"
---

### Goals

- Learn how to undo changes that have been staged.

## _01_ Edit file and stage changes

Make changes to the `hello.html` file in the form of an unwanted comment

<File file="hello.html">
```html
<html>
  <head>
    →<!-- This is an unwanted but staged comment -->←
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Hello, World!</h1>
  </body>
</html>
```
</File>

Stage the modified file.

<Run>
```
git add hello.html
```
</Run>

## _02_ Check the status

Check the status of unwanted changes .

<Run>
```
git status
```
</Run>

<Output>
```git
==include[output/13-01.txt]
```
</Output>

Status shows that the change has been staged and is ready to commit.

## _03_ Restore the staging area

The `restore` command with the `--staged` flag clears the staging area.

<Run>
```
git restore --staged hello.html
```
</Run>

<Output>
```git
==include[output/13-02.txt]
```
</Output>

The `restore` command with the `--staged` option does not change the actual files in the working directory. Therefore, the hello.html still contains unwanted comments. You should be careful, though, because `restore` without the `--staged` flag will also drop the changes in the working directory.

## _04_ Restore the workign tree

Let's restore our file to the state of the last commit.

<Run>
```
git restore hello.html
git status
```
</Run>

<Output>
```git
==include[output/13-03.txt]
```
</Output>

Our working directory is clean again.
