### Goals

- Learn how to create a Git repository from scratch.

## _01_ Create a “Hello, World!” page

Get started in an empty directory (for example, `repositories`, if you downloaded the file from the previous step) and add an empty subdirectory named `work`, then create a `hello.html` file in it with the following contents.

<Run>
```
mkdir work
cd work
touch hello.html
```
</Run>

<File file="hello.html">
```html
Hello, World!
```
</File>

## _02_ Create a repository

So you have a directory that contains one file. Run `git init` in order to create a Git repo from that directory.

<Run>
```
git init
```
</Run>

<Output>
```git
==include[output/02-01.txt]
```
</Output>

## _03_ Add the page to the repository

Now let's add the “Hello, World” page to the repository.

<Run>
```
git add hello.html
git commit -m "Initial Commit"
```
</Run>

You will see:

<Output>
```git
==include[output/02-02.txt]
```
</Output>
