title: "22. Viewing diverging branches"
---

### Goals

- Learn how to view diverging branches in a repository.

## _01_ View current branches

We now have two diverging branches in the repository. Use the following `log` command to view the branches and how they diverge.

<Run>
```
git log --all --graph
```
</Run>

<Output>
```git
==include[output/22-01.txt]
```
</Output>

The `--all` flag guarantees that we see all the branches. By default, only the current branch is displayed.

The `--graph` option adds a simple commit tree represented with basic text lines. We see both branches (`style` and `main`) and that the branch `main` is marked as `HEAD`, meaning that it's current. The common ancestor to both branches is the branch where the "Added copyright statement with email" commit has been introduced.
