title: "26. <code>rebase</code> vs <code>merge</code>"
---

### Goals

- Learn the difference between rebasing and merging.

### Discussion

Let us look at the differences between rebasing and merging. To do this, we need to get back into the repository at the time prior to the first merge, and then repeat the same steps but using relocating instead of merging.

We will use the `reset` command to return the branch to a previous state.
