title: "29. Merging to the <code>main</code> branch"
---

### Goals

- We have kept our `style` branch up to date with the `main` branch (using `rebase`), but now let's merge the `style` branch changes back into the `main`.

## _01_ Merge `style` into `main`

<Run>
```
git switch main
git merge style
```
</Run>

<Output>
```git
==include[output/29-01.txt]
```
</Output>

Since the last commit in `main` directly precedes the last commit of the `style` branch, Git can merge fast-forward by simply moving the branch pointer forward, pointing to the same commit as the `style` branch.

Conflicts do not arise in the fast-forward merge. Also, fast-forward merges do not create a merge commit.

## _02_ Check the logs

<Run>
```
git log --all --graph
```
</Run>

<Output>
```git
==include[output/29-02.txt]
```
</Output>

Now the `style` and `main` branches are identical.
