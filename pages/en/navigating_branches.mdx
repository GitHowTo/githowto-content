title: "19. Switching branches"
---

### Goals

- Learn how to switch between the repository branches.

Now our project has two branches:

<Run>
```
git log --all
```
</Run>

<Output>
```git
==include[output/19-01.txt]
```
</Output>

## _01_ Switching to the `main` branch

To switch between branches, use the `git switch` command.

<Run>
```
git switch main
cat hello.html
```
</Run>

<Output>
```git
==include[output/19-02.txt]
```
</Output>

Now we are on the `main` branch. As you see, the `hello.html` has no traces of `style.css`. Don't worry; it is still in the repository, but we can't see it from the `main` branch.

## _02_ Let us return to the `style` branch

<Run>
```
git switch style
cat hello.html
```
</Run>

<Output>
```git
==include[output/19-03.txt]
```
</Output>

We are back to the `style` branch. As you can see, our CSS-related changes are present.
