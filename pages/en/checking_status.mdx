title: "3. Checking the status of the repository"
---

### Goals

- Learn how to check the repository’s status.

## _01_ Check the status of the repository

Use the `git status` command, to check the current state of the repository.

<Run>
```
git status
```
</Run>

You will see:

<Output>
```git
==include[output/03-01.txt]
```
</Output>

> If you see `On branch master` instead of `On branch main` after running the previous command, it means that you have a slightly older version of Git, which didn't understand us when we asked to set the default branch name to `main`. In this case, you can rename the branch name to `main` with the following command:
> ```
> git branch -m master main
> ```

The command checks the status and reports that there’s nothing to commit, meaning the repository stores the current state of the working directory, and there are no changes to record.

We will use the `git status` command to keep monitoring the states of both the working directory and the repository.
