title: "21. Changes in the <code>main</code> branch"
---

### Goals

- Learn how to work with several branches with different (sometimes conflicting) changes.

As I mentioned previously, Git lets you work with several branches at the same time. It is very useful when working in a team because people can work on different features in parallel. It is also useful when working solo: while developing features in separate branches, you can still fix bugs and release minor updates using stable code in the `main` branch.

## _01_ Create the `README` file

Let's create a `README` file. It will explain what our project is about.

<File file="README">
```
This is the Hello World example from the GitHowTo tutorial.
```
</File>

## _02_ Commit the `README` file to the `main` branch

We are currently in the `style` branch. The `README` file is not part of this branch, so we must switch to the `main` branch before committing the changes.

<Run>
```
git switch main
git add README
git commit -m "Added README"
```
</Run>

<Output>
```git
==include[output/21-01.txt]
```
</Output>
