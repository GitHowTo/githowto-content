title: "8. Changes, not files"
---

### Goals

- Understanding that Git works with the changes, not the files.

Most version control systems work with files. You add the file to source control and the system tracks changes from that moment on.

Git concentrates on the changes to a file, not the file itself. A `git add file` command does not tell Git to add the file to the repository, but to note the current state of the file for it to be committed later.

We will try to investigate the difference in this lesson.

## _01_ First Change: Adding default page tags

Change the "Hello, World" page so that it contained default tags `<html>` and `<body>`.

<File file="hello.html">
```html
→<html>←
  →<body>←
    <h1>Hello, World!</h1>
  →</body>←
→</html>←
```
</File>

## _02_ Add this change

Now add this change to the Git staging.

<Run>
```
git add hello.html
```
</Run>

## _03_ Second change: Add the HTML headers

Now add the HTML headers (`<head>` section) to the "Hello, World" page.

<File file="hello.html">
```html
<html>
  →<head>←
  →</head>←
  <body>
    <h1>Hello, World!</h1>
  </body>
</html>
```
</File>

## _04_ Check the current status

<Run>
```
git status
```
</Run>

You will see:

<Output>
```git
==include[output/08-01.txt]
```
</Output>

Please note that `hello.html` is listed in the status twice. The first change (the addition of default tags) is staged and ready for a commit. The second change (adding HTML headers) is unstaged. If you were making a commit right now, headers would not have been saved to the repository.

Let's check.

## _05_ Commit

Commit the staged changes (default values), then check the status one more time.

<Run>
```
git commit -m "Added standard HTML page tags"
git status
```
</Run>

You will see:

<Output>
```git
==include[output/08-02.txt]
```
</Output>

The `status` command suggests that `hello.html` still has unrecorded changes, but the staging area is already clear.

## _06_ Adding the second change

Add the second change to the staging area, after that run the `git status` command.

<Run>
```
git add .
git status
```
</Run>

> We have used the current directory (`.`) as the argument for the `add` command. This is the shortest and most convenient way to add all changes in the current directory. But since Git adds _everything_ to the index, it's a good idea to check the state of the repository before running `add`, just to make sure you haven't added a file you shouldn't have.
>
> I just wanted to show you the trick with `add .`, from now on we will add all files explicitly.

You will see:

<Output>
```git
==include[output/08-03.txt]
```
</Output>

The second change has been staged and is ready for a commit.

## _07_ Commit the second change

<Run>
```
git commit -m "Added HTML header"
```
</Run>

<Output>
```git
==include[output/08-04.txt]
```
</Output>
